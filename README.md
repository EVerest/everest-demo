# EVerest Demo Repo

## Vision

This repository includes several demos of the [EVerest](https://lfenergy.org/projects/everest/)
tech stack's capabilities. The intent of this repository is to showcase the
foundational layers of a charging solution that could address interoperability
and reliability issues in the EV charging industry. The demonstrations aim to
exemplify the modular nature of EVerest and can be utilized to understand the
following:

- Standards-based implementations for driving interoperability between the EV,
EVSE, and CSMS
- Interoperability testing tools and test suites
- Simulated EVs, EVSEs, etc. following interoperability best practices and
simulating stress testing scenarios

## Hosted Demos

Below is a table of demonstrations that are currently available.

  - EVerest Demos are currently NOT supported on M1 chips
  - On x86 chips, no additional steps needed, move to [Install and Set-up](Install-and-Set-up)
- Linux
  - No additional steps needed, move to [Install and Set-up](Install-and-Set-up)
- Windows
  - Ensure that you are running Windows 10+
  - Install [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https:://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
  (recommended version 2.0)
  - Move to [Install and Set-up](Install-and-Set-up)

## Install and Set-up

1. Install docker with the following link [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

2. Ensure that docker is installed by opening your machines terminal and typing
`docker --version`

   - Note: The terminal should return "Docker version x.x.x".

3. Open the Docker desktop application

4. Open your machines terminal

## Run the Demonstration

### Step 1: Select the Demo

Copy and paste the command for the demo you wish to run into the machines terminal.

- Note: After you enter the command into the terminal, the docker application
should open the associated containers

### Step 2: Open Demo Interface and Supporting Materials

1. Open the demo UI at <http://127.0.0.1:1880/ui>

   - Note: The demo UI will vary based on the demonstration that is selected.
   For the best results, having the demo UI and Docker desktop application up
   side-by-side will allow the user to understand what messages are being sent
   back-and-fourth across the demo actors.

2. Open the `nodered` flows to understand the module flows at <http://127.0.0.1:1880>

   - Note: The nodered flows will allow the user to understand how modules
   interact within the demonstrations. For  more information on simulating
   Everest with software, the simulation GUI, and NODE RED, click [here](https://everest.github.io/nightly/general/03_quick_start_guide.html#simulating-everest)

### Step 3: Interact with the Demo

Feel free to explore these demos on your own accord. Below is a table that will
help the user understand how to interact with the UI.

Note: Only one demonstration can be run at a time, in order to spin up a new demo,
move to Step 4: Teardown before attempting to start new demo.

|Features| Description |
| -- | ---- |
|<img src="img/One_EV_EVSE_UI.png" alt="Demo UI" width="249" height="572"/>| |
| `CAR PLUGIN` | Starts the charging cycle |
| `STOP & UNPLUG` | Stops the charging cycle |
| `EV PAUSE` | Pause the charging session |
| `EV RESUME` | Resume the charging cycle |
| `Car Simulation` dropdown | Changes the charging scenario (i.e., chaos testing) |
| `Max Current` slider | Slide to adjust the current provided to the vehicle |

### Step 4: Teardown

- Select all Docker containers
- Delete all files and containers: `docker compose -p [prefix] down && rm docker-compose.yml`
where `[prefix]` is `everest, everest-dc, everest-two-evse...`

## Additional Functionality  

There are many different variables that the user can experiment with throughout
the demonstrations. See below:

### One EV ↔ EVSE (ISO 15118 AC) Demo

- You can open the SteVe wep portal at <http://localhost:8180/steve/manager/home>.
Login with username: admin, password: 1234 when running the OCPP Demos
- When running the Basic and ISO 15118-2 AC Charging with OCPP 201 CSMS demo,
the script currently checks out the maeve repository and builds it, so it is
fairly slow.
  - It starts the Maeve containers in detached mode, so you would need to use
  docker desktop or `docker logs` to see the logs
  - Note that the OCPP logs are available at `/tmp/everest_ocpp_logs/` on the
  EVerest manager and can be downloaded using the docker desktop or `docker cp`

### All Demos

- You can experiment with different constraints for a demo by exporting `EVEREST_MANAGER_CPUS`
and `EVEREST_MANAGER_MEMORY` environment variables prior to running one of the demos.
The values of these variables can take on any valid Docker
[CPU value](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#configure-the-default-cfs-scheduler)
and [memory limit](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#limit-a-containers-access-to-memory),
respectively. For example, to run a demo with two CPUs and 1536 MB of RAM, you
could execute

```bash
export EVEREST_MANAGER_CPUS='2.0' EVEREST_MANAGER_MEMORY='1536mb'
```

- This demo can be run independently, and exports [the admin panel](https://everest.github.io/nightly/general/03_quick_start_guide.html#admin-panel-and-simulations)
as explained [in this video](https://youtu.be/OJ6kjHRPkyY?t=904).It provides a
visual representation of the configuration and the resulting configurations.
  
- Run the explore configs demo: `curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/everest/everest-demo/main/docker-compose.admin-panel.yml && docker compose -p everest-admin-panel up`
  
- Access the visual representation at <http://localhost:8849>
