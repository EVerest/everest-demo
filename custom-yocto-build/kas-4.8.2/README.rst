This tool provides an easy mechanism to setup bitbake based
projects.

The OpenEmbedded tooling support starts at step 2 with bitbake. The
downloading of sources and then configuration has to be done by
hand. Usually, this is explained in a README. Instead kas is using a
project configuration file and does the download and configuration
phase.

Key features provided by the build tool:

- clone and checkout bitbake layers
- create default bitbake settings (machine, arch, ...)
- launch minimal build environment, reducing risk of host contamination
- initiate bitbake build process

See the `kas documentation <https://kas.readthedocs.io>`_ for further details.

SECURITY NOTICE
---------------

At this stage, kas does not validate the integrity of fetched repositories.
Make sure to only pull from trusted sources to ensure that the selected
revisions are the expected ones, specifically when using mirrors. Later
versions of kas may introduce integrity validation mechanisms such as
cryptographic checksums to strengthen supply chain security.
